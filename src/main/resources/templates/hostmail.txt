Hey [( ${event.host.name} )],

We sent out the following invitations for '[( ${event.title} )]':
[# th:if="${not #lists.isEmpty(successfulResults)}"]
[# th:each="result : ${successfulResults}"]
- [( ${result.name} )], [( ${result.email} )]
[/]
[/]
[# th:if="${not #lists.isEmpty(failedResults)}"]
Mails to the following participants could not be sent:
[# th:each="result : ${failedResults}"]
- [( ${result.name} )], [( ${result.email} )]
[/]
[/]
Please be aware that mails could still bounce and therefore participants not be reached.
